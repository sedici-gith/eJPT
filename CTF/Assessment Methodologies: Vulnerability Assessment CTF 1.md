## Assessment Methodologies: Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1

### Flag 1: Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.

This lab comes along with a Nessus installation.

We use Nessus to scan the target system.

Meanwhile, we proceed with an Nmap scan.
```
nmap -sS -Pn -O -sV -p- target.ine.local
```
The Nmap scan reveals two open ports:
```
80 - Apache
3306 - mysql
```
While analyzing the results of scanning the target system with dirb:
```
dirb http://target.ine.local
```
we find the fourth flag in a file flag.txt located in:
```
http://target.ine.local/passwords/flag.txt
```
We approach the problem with Gobuster:
```
gobuster dir -u http://target.ine.local/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -b 404,403 -k
```
among the results we find /.git/HEAD file. This leads us to /.git/ folder containing flag.txt file in which we discover the first flag.


### Flag 2: The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?

We find phpMyAdmin publicly available and ready to be exploited.

While browsing MySQL database, we find the secret_info where the second flag lies.

### Flag 3: A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?

The file phpinfo.php found under the phpMyAdmin path does not contain the flag, so we continue searching for it in other paths.
```
gobuster dir -u http://target.ine.local/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -x txt,php -b 404,403 -k
```
We discover it in the root folder, alongside with the third flag.


### Flag 4: Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.

This was found along with the first flag.

An alternative method to approach all these questions is to use Nmap with http-enum script.
